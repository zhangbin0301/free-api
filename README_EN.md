| Grok | grok-4.1-fast | Best suited for image generation, with fewer conversation restrictions |
| Claude | claude-sonnet-4.6 | new,test |
| Qwen | qwen3.5-flash | Tongyi Qianwen |

> Update: `gpt-5.4` and `gpt-5.3-codex` are available again and can be used directly.

> Note: `Grok` `Claude` and `Qwen` do not support tool calling. Attempting to use tools with them may produce unreliable results.
